			The Mortality Statistics Branch is a part of the Division of Vital Statistics (DVS) at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
        which is within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the mission of NCHS to provide accurate, relevant,
        and timely statistical information to inform policies with the goal of improving the health of the American people. DVS
        collaborates with the vital registration systems of various jurisdictions throughout the United States to collect, process,
        and analyze mortality data for the population, including geographic, demographic, and cause of death information. These data
        are used to determine the characteristics of those dying in the United States and to calculate mortality rates and life expectancies.
